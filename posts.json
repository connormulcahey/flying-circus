The St. Lawrences\u2019 \u201cback yard\u201d was expansive, and frequently with help from his dad, he and his friends would hold small track meets. Tim was usually a leading point-getter in those meets. Nothing much changed as he grew as an athlete. He was usually one of the best athletes in any contest he competed in.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>In 1962, when Tim was in eighth grade, a pole vaulter named John Uelses became the first to clear the 16-foot barrier. He was using a pole made of fiberglass as well as a new technique. Tim knew at that point that he wanted to be a pole vaulter. As a freshman at Suffern High, he matched the school record of 11 feet 6 inches set in 1955, and later that year cleared 12 feet. He, along with David Mumme of Spring Valley, pioneered the use of the fiberglass pole in this area. In four years (1963 through 1966), he helped to bring high school vaulting to an entire new level of achievement. County championships typically won at 11 feet now ascended to 12, 13, and eventually 14 feet plus in a matter of just four years.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Never selfish about his knowledge of the event, he conducted clinics for his competitors that lifted the level of local competition exponentially. The landing pit erected in the St. Lawrences\u2019 back yard (ball nets stuffed with strips of foam rubber recovered from the International Nickel Plant in Sloatsburg) was probably one of the best places around for a young vaulter to learn and excel. It became a local mecca where pole vaulters could come to \u201cplay.\u201d Just a couple of years later as Tim became a collegian, the back-yard pit hosted some of the best pole vaulters in the nation, as they would drop by to visit and train.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Tim capped an outstanding run in high school by winning the pole vault at the New York State championships in 1966. His winning performance of 14-5 \u00bc set a New York State record, and 44 years later it remains as the Suffern High School record in the event.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>At the University of Alabama he won four varsity letters in track and field. At the Alabama Relays in 1971, he set an Alabama school record with a personal best performance of 17 feet, 1 \u00bc inches. After college, he competed for the New York Athletic Club, where he won 19 consecutive Metropolitan Association pole vault championships \u2013 nine indoors and 10 outdoors. This is a Metropolitan Association record for an individual in any track and field event that still stands today. During this time he competed in the 1972 U.S. Olympic Trials, and represented the U.S.A. in meets in Edinburgh, Scotland; Ontario, Canada; and Tel Aviv, Israel. He was on the East team of the inaugural Olympic Sports Festival in 1976. If you ask Tim what time it is today, he possibly would be looking at the watch he won as champion of the Penn Relays Olympic Development pole vault in 1976, where he jumped 16-6.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Following the inspiration of his father, Tim, sought a career in teaching and coaching. As superb as he was as an athlete, as a coach he has been simply sensational. He coached for 33 seasons in track and cross country at Warwick Valley High School in Orange County. His cross country teams won 27 championships there and won the NYSPHSAA state title four times (1982, 1994, 1995 and 2007). His outdoor track teams won 30 championships and were New York State Class B champions in 1997. He began the indoor track program in 1978, and the team won 20 championships under his tutelage.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>In 1997 he was honored as the National Federation of High Schools Athletic Association\u2019s Cross Country Coach of the Year.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Tim has coached 40 state champions (22 in cross country, 18 in track), 32 high school All-Americas, and has had 18 teams over the years ranked nationally. His cross country teams compiled a dual-meet winning streak of 156 victories, while his outdoor track teams amassed an even more remarkable streak of 167 consecutive wins.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>His incredible enthusiasm for track and field has now been communicated to two generations. He has become a master promoter of the sport, and is currently the director of the Purple Wave Fast Times Relays \u2013 one of the most popular meets among athletes in the area. In 2006 he also started a highly successful pole-vaulting academy, the Hudson Valley Flying Circus, in Warwick.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Many of Tim\u2019s graduates have gone on to excel in collegiate track \u2013 including an NCAA champion.

Each athlete must be a current member of USATF for all activities. All accepted athletes  will be posted  at our web site when our  classes  are  full.\n\n\n <h3>\"MAKINGS of CHAMPIONS\"</h3>\n\n   Many things have changed the past 25 years  here @ Flying Circus. Pole Vaulting at most high schools and clubs in this country is a loner's   sport\u2026with only a few daring boys  and girls participating in pole vault on  every team.  But, then  you pole vault here  and everything is different. \n\n   At Flying Circus\u2026our concept is  about TEAM POLE VAULTING. Helping each other becomes  the beauty of our participation. Each vaulter pushes in the team direction\u2026. assisting\u2026motivating\u2026. encouraging and caring for each other all the way.  Practice sessions   are filled  with positivity  and   spirited leadership .  Our motto is  \"Dedication trumps Talent\"  and  the journey of  pole vault development is shared.\n\n  Winning is  fun. Sure.  But winning is not entirely the point.\n  Preparing yourself to excel is the point of sport. Never giving up is the point. Never letting each other down is the point. Competing with Spirit\u2026Class ...  and Dignity is the point of athletic participation here at Flying Circus. You develop a real sense of responsibility to each other   and to your school. You  begin to measure up to the very best that is in you\u2026your focus  and goals take on  a special meaning.\n\n Things have changed at Flying Circus since that first  November evening in  1992   at the Warwick Valley Middle School Pole Vault Gym  session\u2026.when Coach Cauthers  and Coach St. combined  efforts  to  begin  a true pole vault  club  for all athletes\u2026..all ages\u2026all schools\u2026\u2026  The Flying Circus has launched based on the spirit  and attitudes of many focused  dedicated   and tough kids  committed to supporting each other at   very turn\u2026..     Thank You  for making  FLYING CIRCUS a positive happening!!!!\n\n\n  <h3>UP-COMING  FLYING CIRCUS PRE-SEASON MEETS</h3>\n\n  Come Join-the-Mix\u2026. and have  some great fun together\u2026.Flying Circus Home barn Meets just  4 weeks away !!!!!\n  \n  CIRCUS #1  ..Saturday October  28, 2017   Girls Meet at 10:01AM   Boys Meet at 2:01PM\u2026  Cost ..Still Just $30/Athlete\n\n  CIRCUS #2   ..Saturday  November 4, 2017   Girls Meet  at 10:01AM  Boys Meet at 2:01PM  .

The strength of our  pole vault instruction is our  drills program.  We use  365 + pole vault  drills  at various   cycles  during our  10 month pole vault  development program here at Flying Circus.  Each athlete  is training  for   drill mastery in each   21 day  macro  cycle  and then moves up  our progressive  drills... These  drills are the backbone of our pole vault development   and have proven  the 'European Style\" still prevails in the pole vault training method.  Drills on Run Posture/Stride Length,Stride Balance...Gymnastic Drills on High Bar,Rings,Trapeze,Ropes are a must  for each pole vaulter to \"feel-the-positions\"  that  will transfer to the in flight mechanics  on the   fiberglass pole.
