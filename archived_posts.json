Two are opposite each other and share a runway. Having five pits allows us split up our vaulters into different groups for a better learning experience that is targeted toward their ability. Having both indoor and outdoor facilities also allows us to practice and compete year round, rain or shine.</p>\n\t</div></div>",

Joe St. Lawrence was the 25-year coach of Suffern High\u2019s track team from the 1940s through the mid-\u201960s, before entering the state Legislature and later serving as the County treasurer. His sons all embraced his enthusiastic love of track and field and excelled each in their own way in the sport.</p>\n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Timothy, the second son of Marguerite and Joe St. Lawrence, showed the promise of athletic greatness even as a small child. He excelled at basketball, football, swimming, diving and being able to amaze his friends with his ability to do acrobatic tricks. The St. Lawrences\u2019 \u201cback yard\u201d was expansive, and frequently with help from his dad, he and his friends would hold small track meets. Tim was usually a leading point-getter in those meets. Nothing much changed as he grew as an athlete. He was usually one of the best athletes in any contest he competed in.</p>\n  <p>\n      <em><strong>\n        <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.rctfhalloffame.com/tim-st-lawrence.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Continue Reading...</a>\n      </strong></em>\n    </p>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n  <div class=\"staffBlock clearfix\">\n  <h2>Hugh Cauthers</h2>\n  <p><img src=\"http://www.hvflyingcircus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hughcauthers.jpeg\" alt=\"Hugh Cauthers\"></p>\n  <p>Hugh Cauthers. was born to coach.
