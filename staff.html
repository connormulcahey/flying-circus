  <p><em><strong>The following is an <a href="http://www.rctfhalloffame.com/tim-st-lawrence.html">article</a> from the <a href="http://www.rctfhalloffame.com/">Rockland County Track &amp; Field Hall of Fame</a>:</strong></em></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When looking at the history of track and field in Rockland County, one cannot avoid frequent encounters with the surname St. Lawrence. Joe St. Lawrence was the 25-year coach of Suffern High’s track team from the 1940s through the mid-’60s, before entering the state Legislature and later serving as the County treasurer. His sons all embraced his enthusiastic love of track and field and excelled each in their own way in the sport.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Timothy, the second son of Marguerite and Joe St. Lawrence, showed the promise of athletic greatness even as a small child. He excelled at basketball, football, swimming, diving and being able to amaze his friends with his ability to do acrobatic tricks. The St. Lawrences’ “back yard” was expansive, and frequently with help from his dad, he and his friends would hold small track meets. Tim was usually a leading point-getter in those meets. Nothing much changed as he grew as an athlete. He was usually one of the best athletes in any contest he competed in.</p>
