Originally from West Milford, NJ, Colette (Coco) Metcalf grew up going to the barn for vault sessions at Hudson Valley Flying Circus, where her love for pole vault truly began. Now, with over 8 years of vaulting experience, she’s passionate about giving back to the place that shaped her by coaching and supporting the next generation of athletes.

A proud alumna of St. John’s University, Coco graduated summa cum laude with a degree in Elementary Education and a concentration in English. She competed as a pole vaulter in NCAA Division I Track and Field within the Big East Conference and had the incredible opportunity to compete internationally in Padova, Italy, and the French Alps.

Coco brings both a strong competitive background and a love for teaching to her coaching, blending technical skill with encouragement to help athletes grow in confidence and ability.
