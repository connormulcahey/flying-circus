      <p>The Barn is one of two main practice areas at The Flying Circus and houses 2 pits, over 225 poles and several apparatus for off the pit drills. The barn is also wired with a high tech camera system to give instant replays of jumps as well as a speaker system for music to be enjoyed both indoors and out.</p>

      <p>The outdoor facility also has three pits, for a total of five. Two are opposite each other and share a runway. Having five pits allows us split up our vaulters into different groups for a better learning experience that is targeted toward their ability. Having both indoor and outdoor facilities also allows us to practice and compete year round, rain or shine.</p>
