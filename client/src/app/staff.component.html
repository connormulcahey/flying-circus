      <p><em><strong>The following is an <a href="http://www.rctfhalloffame.com/tim-st-lawrence.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article</a> from the <a href="http://www.rctfhalloffame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rockland County Track & Field Hall of Fame</a>:</strong></em></p>
      
      <p>When looking at the history of track and field in Rockland County, one cannot avoid frequent encounters with the surname St. Lawrence. Joe St. Lawrence was the 25-year coach of Suffern High's track team from the 1940s through the mid-'60s, before entering the state Legislature and later serving as the County treasurer. His sons all embraced his enthusiastic love of track and field and excelled each in their own way in the sport.</p>
      
      <p>Timothy, the second son of Marguerite and Joe St. Lawrence, showed the promise of athletic greatness even as a small child. He excelled at basketball, football, swimming, diving and being able to amaze his friends with his ability to do acrobatic tricks. The St. Lawrences' "back yard" was expansive, and frequently with help from his dad, he and his friends would hold small track meets. Tim was usually a leading point-getter in those meets. Nothing much changed as he grew as an athlete. He was usually one of the best athletes in any contest he competed in.</p>

      <p><strong>In Loving Memory of Hugh Cauthers</strong><br>
      <em>August 22, 1946 - October 26, 2024</em></p>
      
      <p>It is with heavy hearts that we share the passing of our beloved coach, mentor, and friend, Hugh Cauthers, who left us peacefully on October 26, 2024. Hugh's impact on the pole vaulting community and the countless lives he touched cannot be measured in words alone.</p>
      
      <p>Hugh Cauthers was born to coach. As a Monroe-Woodbury Central High School (NY) teacher and coach for 45 years, he developed championship teams in Boys Soccer and Boys & Girls Indoor and Outdoor Track & Field. He promoted the field events for legendary coaches Dick Wilson, Lou Hall, and Jim Glover in the "Crusaderland of Purple Pride." His athletes dominated all four jumping events (Long Jump, High Jump, Pole Vault, Triple Jump) throughout those 45 years, but his true passion was the Pole Vault.</p>
      
      <p>Hugh made history when he sued NY State to provide the Pole Vault Event for Girls in 1998, successfully breaking down barriers and creating opportunities for female athletes. He proceeded to coach Michelle Mercado to the National Record (12′ 9.75″) in 1999, Alana Carroll to National Gold, and Stephanie Duffy to National Silver in the Vault. In 2000, Hugh co-founded the Hudson Valley Flying Circus, opening the doors for all area athletes wishing to fly higher on fiberglass.</p>
      
      <p>Beyond his impressive coaching achievements, Hugh was a master teacher and innovator of drills in both soccer and pole vault. He was the ultimate role model - a leader who attracted and convinced his athletes to believe beyond themselves. His ability to make each athlete feel special and capable of greatness was his greatest gift.</p>
      
      <p>Coach Cauthers was elected into the esteemed Section 9 Track & Field Hall of Fame for his outstanding contributions in athletics. He was a Master Team Coach, the "King Innovator" of drills in soccer and pole vault, and a true role model for all. His leadership was his strong trait - he attracted and convinced his athletes to believe beyond themselves.</p>
      
      <p>Hugh Cauthers was filled with gratitude and kindness, making us all better humans. He is considered by all to be "The Father of the Girls Pole Vault" in New York State. We are blessed to have his spirit with us at the Flying Circus, where his legacy continues to inspire new generations of pole vaulters.</p>
